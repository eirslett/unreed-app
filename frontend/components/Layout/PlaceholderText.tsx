      <h1>Info from Wikipedia about the oboe</h1>
      <p>
        The oboe (/ˈoʊboʊ/ OH-boh) is a type of double reed woodwind instrument.
        Oboes are usually made of wood, but may also be made of synthetic
        materials, such as plastic, resin, or hybrid composites. The most common
        oboe plays in the treble or soprano range.
      </p>
      <p>
        A soprano oboe measures roughly 65 cm (25+1⁄2 in) long, with metal keys,
        a conical bore and a flared bell. Sound is produced by blowing into the
        reed at a sufficient air pressure, causing it to vibrate with the air
        column.[1] The distinctive tone is versatile and has been described as
        "bright".[2] When the word oboe is used alone, it is generally taken to
        mean the treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family,
        such as the bass oboe, the cor anglais (English horn), or oboe d'amore.

        Today, the oboe is commonly used as orchestral or solo instrument in
        symphony orchestras, concert bands and chamber ensembles. The oboe is
        especially used in classical music, film music, some genres of folk
        music, and is occasionally heard in jazz, rock, pop, and popular music.
        The oboe is widely recognized as the instrument that tunes the orchestra
        with its distinctive 'A'.[3]

      <p>A musician who plays the oboe is called an oboist.</p>
      <h2>Sound</h2>
      <p>
        Sound In comparison to other modern woodwind instruments, the treble
        oboe is sometimes referred to as having a "bright and penetrating"
        voice.[4][5] The Sprightly Companion, an instruction book published by
        Henry Playford in 1695, describes the oboe as "Majestical and Stately,
        and not much Inferior to the Trumpet".[6] In the play Angels in America
        the sound is described as like "that of a duck if the duck were a
        songbird".[7] The rich timbre is derived from its conical bore (as
        opposed to the generally cylindrical bore of flutes and clarinets). As a
        result, oboes are easier to hear over other instruments in large
        ensembles due to its penetrating sound.[8] The highest note is a
        semitone lower than the nominally highest note of the B♭ clarinet. Since
        the clarinet has a wider range, the lowest note of the B♭ clarinet is
        significantly deeper (a minor sixth) than the lowest note of the
        oboe.[9]

      <p>
        Music for the standard oboe is written in concert pitch (i.e., it is not
        a transposing instrument), and the instrument has a soprano range,
        usually from B♭3 to G6. Orchestras tune to a concert A played by the
        first oboe.[10] According to the League of American Orchestras, this is
        done because the pitch is secure and its penetrating sound makes it
        ideal for tuning.[11] The pitch of the oboe is affected by the way in
        which the reed is made. The reed has a significant effect on the sound.
        Variations in cane and other construction materials, the age of the
        reed, and differences in scrape and length all affect the pitch. German
        and French reeds, for instance, differ in many ways, causing the sound
        to vary accordingly. Weather conditions such as temperature and humidity
        also affect the pitch. Skilled oboists adjust their embouchure to
        compensate for these factors. Subtle manipulation of embouchure and air
        pressure allows the oboist to express timbre and dynamics.

      <h2>Reeds</h2>
      <p>
        The oboe uses a double reed, similar to that used for the bassoon.[12]
        Most professional oboists make their reeds to suit their individual
        needs. By making their reeds, oboists can precisely control factors such
        as tone color, intonation, and responsiveness. They can also account for
        individual embouchure, oral cavity, oboe angle, and air support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Novice oboists rarely make their own reeds, as the process is difficult
        and time consuming, and frequently purchase reeds from a music store
        instead. Commercially available cane reeds are available in several
        degrees of hardness; a medium reed is very popular, and most beginners
        use medium-soft reeds. These reeds, like clarinet, saxophone, and
        bassoon reeds, are made from Arundo donax. As oboists gain more
        experience, they may start making their own reeds after the model of
        their teacher or buying handmade reeds (usually from a professional
        oboist) and using special tools including gougers, pre-gougers,
        guillotines, knives, and other tools to make and adjust reeds to their
        liking.[13] The reed is considered the part of oboe that makes the
        instrument so difficult because the individual nature of each reed means
        that it is hard to achieve a consistent sound. Slight variations in
        temperature, humidity, altitude, weather, and climate can also have an
        effect on the sound of the reed, as well as minute changes in the
        physique of the reed.[14]
      </p>
      <p>
        Oboists often prepare several reeds to achieve a consistent sound, as
        well as to prepare for environmental factors such as chipping of a reed
        or other hazards. Oboists may have different preferred methods for
        soaking their reeds to produce optimal sounds; the most preferred method
        tends to be to soak the oboe reed in water before playing.[15]
      </p>
      <p>
        Plastic oboe reeds are rarely used, and are less readily available than
        plastic reeds for other instruments, such as the clarinet. However, they
        do exist, and are produced by brands such as Legere.[16]
